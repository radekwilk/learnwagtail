HOW TO START WAGTAIL PROJECT

1. Ensure we have Python installed. To do so we can run command

     python -V

2. Next, we have to create virtual environment. One of the methods of use of pipenv. We can run this commands:

    pipenv install
    pipenv shell

3. Now we can install Wagtail, run this command:

    pip install wagtail

4. Once completed, we can check if Wagtail is installed, by running this command:

    pip show wagtail

5. We can also check all the packages installed in my virtual environment by running this command:

    pip freeze

6. Now we can start new wagtail project. Let's name it rocketman. We can run this command:

    wagtail start rocketman    (if we already have rocketman folder, we can runs this command: wagtail start rocketman .  This do at the end will ensure project is created in existing rocketman folder)

7. And them we can install all requirements by running this command:

     pip install -r requirements.txt

8. And now we can run server by running this command:

    py manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

9. Now we should see that many files are needs to be migrated. Run this command:

    py manage.py migrate

10. If we want to get out of pipenv we need to click Ctrl + D

11. Now we will need to create super user to be able to access admin panel

    py manage.py createsuperuser

    Username:
    Email:
    Password:
    Password (again):

12. Once we make any changes to our models.py file, we need to makemigrations:

    py manage.py makemigrations

    and then migrate

    py manage.py migrate
